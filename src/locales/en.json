      "title": "Enlightened Mortality: Time as the Ultimate Currency",
      "description": "Instead of fear - gratitude. Limited time stops being a threat and becomes life's priority algorithm. You stop being 'managed by the calendar' - you manage your existence through conscious choices.",
      "quote": "We don't have too little time, but we waste much of it.",

      "description": "You don't plan your day based on the clock, but on your biological rhythms. You act in moments of power and regenerate during downturns - achieving more while burning out less.",
