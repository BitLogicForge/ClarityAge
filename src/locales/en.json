    "q1": {
      "title": "Enlightened Mortality: Time as the Ultimate Currency",
      "description": "This philosophy reframes the finite nature of time from a source of fear into a tool for prioritization. Recognizing that time is limited clarifies what is truly important, encouraging conscious and meaningful choices about how we live.",
      "quote": "We don't have too little time, but we waste much of it.",
      "author": "Seneca",
      "question": "If I were to audit my last week, would I be satisfied with where my time—my most finite resource—was allocated?"
    },
    "q2": {
      "title": "The Enough™ Principle 2.0",
      "description": "This principle challenges the relentless pursuit of 'more' by distinguishing between needs and wants. It focuses on designing a life that values balance, function, and comfort over endless consumption, redefining success as contentment rather than accumulation.",
      "quote": "The things you own end up owning you.",
      "author": "Tyler Durden (Fight Club)",
      "question": "What am I pursuing out of a genuine need for well-being, and what am I pursuing out of habit or external expectation?"
    },
    "q3": {
      "title": "Energy Management, Not Time Management",
      "description": "Instead of viewing productivity through the lens of a 24-hour clock, this approach prioritizes the body's natural biological rhythms. The aim is to align tasks with periods of peak energy and allow for intentional regeneration during lulls, leading to greater output with less burnout.",
      "quote": "We're not tired from work, we're tired from doing meaningless things.",
      "author": "Greg McKeown",
      "question": "When during the day do I feel most effective and creative, and how can I better protect and utilize those specific times?"
    },
    "q4": {
      "title": "The Art of Sacred NO",
      "description": "Every commitment (a 'yes') consumes our finite resources of time and energy. This philosophy treats the act of refusal ('no') as a powerful strategic tool to protect the space required for our most important priorities, free from guilt.",
      "quote": "Boundaries are not a wall - they're a gateway with selective access.",
      "author": "Brené Brown",
      "question": "What have I said 'yes' to recently that, in hindsight, should have been a 'no', and what was the true cost of that commitment?"
    },
    "q5": {
      "title": "Earn Wisely, Not More",
      "description": "Financial maturity is viewed not by the size of one's income, but by the quality of one's financial choices. This philosophy emphasizes using money as a tool to increase personal freedom, autonomy, and security, rather than for spectacle or status.",
      "quote": "It's not wealth that makes you free, but how you use it.",
      "author": "Morgan Housel",
      "question": "Are my financial habits primarily creating more options and freedom in my life, or are they creating new forms of obligation?"
    },
    "q6": {
      "title": "Body as Capital",
      "description": "This philosophy approaches physical health as a long-term investment that compounds over time. Consistent care in areas like nutrition, exercise, and sleep is seen not as a chore, but as a strategic deposit that pays dividends in future longevity, strength, and mental clarity.",
      "quote": "Your health is what you invest, not what just happens.",
      "author": "Peter Attia",
      "question": "What is one small, consistent investment I could make in my physical health today that would pay off significantly in 10 years?"
    },
    "q7": {
      "title": "Relationships of Reciprocity",
      "description": "Recognizing that social energy is limited, this philosophy encourages a conscious allocation of that energy. It prioritizes relationships based on mutual support, growth, and exchange, while gracefully letting go of connections that are consistently one-sided or draining.",
      "quote": "Not everyone who was part of your past needs to be part of your future.",
      "author": "Trent Shelton",
      "question": "Which of my relationships consistently leave me feeling energized and seen, and which ones tend to leave me feeling depleted?"
    },
    "q8": {
      "title": "Experience Capital",
      "description": "This concept treats one's entire history—including mistakes, failures, and lessons learned—as a valuable form of capital. Past experiences, when reflected upon, become a unique asset that can inform better decisions, mentoring, and design in the present.",
      "quote": "Experience is the name we give to our mistakes.",
      "author": "Oscar Wilde",
      "question": "What past failure or mistake holds a lesson that I am not fully utilizing today?"
    },
    "q9": {
      "title": "Emotional Radar",
      "description": "This is the practice of developing emotional intelligence as an early warning system. It involves recognizing which interactions and environments are nourishing versus which are draining or chaotic, allowing for proactive measures to protect one's inner calm.",
      "quote": "People aren't toxic - but their behaviors can be lethally contagious.",
      "author": "Susan David",
      "question": "When did I last feel a sense of emotional chaos, and what behavior or environment triggered it?"
    },
    "q10": {
      "title": "Legacy Thinking",
      "description": "This mindset shifts the focus from short-term personal achievements to long-term, lasting impact. It prompts one to consider what of value—knowledge, kindness, creations, or principles—will remain for others long after they are gone.",
      "quote": "Plant trees under which you'll never sit.",
      "author": "Greek maxim",
      "question": "Beyond my own accomplishments, what am I building, teaching, or contributing that could benefit the next generation?"
    },
    "q11": {
      "title": "Systems, Not Parts",
      "description": "This philosophy encourages viewing one's life as an interconnected ecosystem rather than a collection of separate projects. The goal is to create synergy where different areas—such as work, health, and relationships—mutually support and reinforce one another.",
      "quote": "Only when everything plays together does life play your melody.",
      "author": "James Clear",
      "question": "Which area of my life, if improved, would create the most positive ripple effect across all other areas?"
    },
    "q12": {
      "title": "Joy of Integration",
      "description": "This is the deep satisfaction that arises not from achieving perfection, but from creating coherence among one's values, actions, and various life domains. It is the feeling that one's life, while imperfect, is a unified whole where everything has its place.",
      "quote": "When every part of your life plays on the same team, you start winning.",
      "author": "Cal Newport",
      "question": "In which moments or activities do I feel the most 'whole'—where my actions, values, and identity are all in alignment?"
